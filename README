WHAT IS IT?
===========

Allows you to easily do find and counts based on date ranges.

You can either pass a symbol:

  :today, :yesterday, :last_year, :this_year, :this_month, :last_month, :month_to_date
  
Or you can pass a range:

  (Time.now-5.days, Time.now+5.days)


Examples
--------

  Book.count(:when => :yesterday) # defaults filtering based on created_at if field isn't specified

  Book.count(:when => :this_month, :when_field => :updated_at)

  Book.find(:when => (Date.new(2002),Date.local(2006)), :when_field => :deleted_at)
